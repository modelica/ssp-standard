System Structure and Parameterization (SSP) is a tool independent standard to define complete systems consisting of one or more component models, including FMUs and their parameterization that can be transferred between simulation tools.

This specification, as well as supporting XML schema files, is provided on https://ssp-standard.org/[ssp-standard.org].

*Abstract*

This document defines the SSP standard as a tool-independent format for the description, packaging and exchange of system structures and their parameterization.
The standard is comprised of a set of XML-based formats to describe a network of component models with their signal flow and parameterization, as well as a ZIP-based packaging format for efficient distribution of entire systems, including any referenced models and other resources.
