== Common Content (SSC)

Common Structures and Attributes that are used across all XML Schemas are defined in the SystemStructureCommon.xsd Schema, which is imported by all other XML Schemas.
All Types and AttributeGroups live in the http://ssp-standard.org/SSP1/SystemStructureCommon namespace, nicknamed ssc.

=== Common Attributes

All XML elements that correspond to an entity of the system model will have the following set of common XML attributes, as defined in the ssc:ABaseElement attribute group:

image:images/image1.png[image,width=261,height=101]

[width="100%",cols="18%,82%",options="header",]
|===
|Attribute |Description
|id |This optional attribute gives the model entity a file-wide unique id which can be referenced from other entities or via URI fragment identifier.
|description |This optional attribute gives a human readable longer description of the model entity, which can be shown to the user where appropriate.
|===

=== Common XML Child Elements

All XML elements that correspond to an entity of the system model will have the following set of common child elements:

image:images/image2.png[image,width=324,height=35]

[width="100%",cols="18%,82%",options="header",]
|===
|Element |Description
|Annotations |This optional element can be used to give additional information for any model entity. When it is present, it *MUST* contain 1 or more Annotation elements as specified below.
|===

Each annotation is encapsulated in an Annotation element, with a required type attribute specifying the type of the annotation, and arbitrary XML content from arbitrary namespaces.

image:images/image3.png[image,width=310,height=137]

In order to ensure uniqueness the annotation type *SHOULD* be provided in reverse domain name notation [ _cf.
Java package names or Apple UTIs_ ] of a domain that is controlled by the entity defining the semantics and content of the annotation.
For vendor-specific annotations this *SHOULD* be a domain controlled by the tool vendor.
For MAP-SSP-defined annotations, this *MUST* be a domain under the org.modelica or org.ssp-standard prefixes.
Annotations that are not defined by MAP SSP *MUST NOT* use these two prefixes,

This mechanism can be used both for tool-specific annotations, as well as for layered standards (see section 2.2) and other agreed-upon extensions, and thus provides a generic extension mechanism.

=== Top-Level Attributes

Top-level attributes are optional meta-data attributes common to all top-level container elements of all defined file formats.

image:images/image4.png[image,width=348,height=317]

[width="100%",cols="28%,72%",options="header",]
|===
|Attribute |Description
|author |Optional attribute giving the name and/or organization of the author of the contents of this file.
|fileversion |Optional attribute giving the version of the contents of this file.
|copyright |Optional attribute giving information about copyrights of the contents of this file.
|license |Optional attribute giving information about licensing of the contents of this file.
|generationTool |Optional attribute giving information about the tool used to generate this file.
|generationDateAndTime |Optional attribute giving the date and time this file was generated.
|===

=== Top-Level XML Child Elements

Top-level elements of a defined file format may have the following set of common child elements.

By design, the enumeration and unit definitions for each file are included in that file directly (i.e. enumeration and unit definitions are file scoped).
This is intended to ensure the separate portability of individual files, with each file containing a self-consistent set of information.
When processing information from multiple files, either from the same or separate system structures, it is up to the importing implementation to deal with any inconsistencies between files found.

==== Enumerations

image:images/image5.png[image,width=397,height=47]

This optional element *MUST* contain definitions for all enumerations referenced in a file.

{empty}[ _As a file-based interchange standard, the natural scope for units and enumerations is the file scope, so that files can be parsed and processed separately, without the need for cross-file references or scoped references with the possibilities of shadowing and ambiguities.
Upon import tools are free to merge unit information across files or separate them between hierarchy layers as they see fit._ ]

image:images/image6.png[image,width=441,height=273]

Each enumeration is defined through an Enumeration XML element:

[width="100%",cols="28%,72%",options="header",]
|===
|Attribute |Description
|name |This required attribute provides a name, which *MUST* be unique within the set of enumerations in a given file.
|===

The following XML child elements are specified for the Enumeration element:

[width="100%",cols="18%,82%",options="header",]
|===
|Element |Description
|Item |One or more elements specifying the items of the enumeration.
| |
|===

===== Item

image:images/image7.png[image,width=225,height=149]

For each item in the enumeration there is one Item XML element with the following attributes:

[width="100%",cols="28%,72%",options="header",]
|===
|Attribute |Description
|name |This required attribute provides a name for the enumeration item.
|value |This required attribute provides a value for the enumeration item.
|===

==== Units

image:images/image8.png[image,width=315,height=47]

This optional element *MUST* contain definitions for all units referenced in a file.

{empty}[ _As a file-based interchange standard, the natural scope for units and enumerations is the file scope, so that files can be parsed and processed separately, without the need for cross-file references or scoped references with the possibilities of shadowing and ambiguities.
Upon import tools are free to merge unit information across files or separate them between hierarchy layers as they see fit._ ]

=== XML Element Choices

These XML elements choices are common to multiple file formats.
They are used inside elements to select one of multiple child elements.

==== Type Choice

image:images/image11.png[image,width=312,height=203]

The following XML child elements denote the data type of a connector or dictionary entry.
_[ Note that in the case of connectors the use of a type element itself is optional, in the case of dictionary entries it is required ]_.

[width="100%",cols="33%,67%",options="header",]
|===
|Element |Description
|Real / Float64 / Float32 / +
Integer / Int8 / UInt8 / Int16 / UInt16 / +
Int32 / UInt32 / Int64 / UInt64 / +
Boolean / String / Enumeration / Binary |Exactly one of these elements *MUST* be present to specify the type of the element. See below for details.
|===

===== Real

|===
|Attribute |Description
|unit |This optional attribute gives the name of a unit. The name *MUST* match the name of a Unit entry in the Units XML element of the top-level element of the file. +
If the attribute is not supplied, the unit is determined through default mechanisms: For FMU components, the unit of the underlying variable would be used, or no unit, if no unit is specified. For systems, the units of connected underlying connectors could be used if unambiguous. If a unit (or its absence) cannot be deduced unambinguously, the user should be informed of this error. Notwithstanding these mechanisms, unitless variables of type Real are supported.
| |
|===

===== Float64

If the attribute is not supplied, the unit is determined through default mechanisms: For FMU components, the unit of the underlying variable would be used, or no unit, if no unit is specified. For systems, the units of connected underlying connectors could be used if unambiguous. If a unit (or its absence) cannot be deduced unambinguously, the user should be informed of this error. Notwithstanding these mechanisms, unitless variables of type Float64 are supported.

If the attribute is not supplied, the unit is determined through default mechanisms: For FMU components, the unit of the underlying variable would be used, or no unit, if no unit is specified. For systems, the units of connected underlying connectors could be used if unambiguous. If a unit (or its absence) cannot be deduced unambinguously, the user should be informed of this error. Notwithstanding these mechanisms, unitless variables of type Float32 are supported.

|===
|Attribute |Description
|mime-type a|
This optional attribute specifies the MIME type of the underlying binary data, which defaults to the non-specific application/octet-stream type. This information *CAN* be used by the implementation to detect mismatches between connected binary connectors, or provide automatic means of conversion between different formats. It should be noted that the implementation is *not required* to provide this service, i.e. it remains the responsibility of the operator to ensure only compatible binary connectors are connected.

The attribute value *MUST* be a valid MIME type as specified in RFC 2045; it *CAN* include additional arguments, etc., as specified in RFC 2045.

Each mapping table entry is provided by a MapEntry element.
Mapping entries *MUST* be unambiguous, i.e. for a given source value at a maximum one entry specifying that source value *MUST* be present.
The mapping does not have to be complete, i.e. partial mappings *CAN* be specified.
In that case values not mapped by a mapping entry are kept unchanged.

In that case values not mapped by a mapping entry are kept unchanged.

When mapping to an Enumeration type, the target value *MUST* be a valid enumeration value for that type.
When mapping from an Enumeration type, the source value *MUST* be a valid enumeration value for that type.
This transformation can be applied between connectors of different Enumeration types, as long as all resulting target values are valid in the target Enumeration type.

The target values provided in transformation entries *MUST* be limited to the value space of the target connector.
The source values provided in transformation entries *CAN* exceed the value space of the source connector.
Such entries are ignored in the mapping process.
